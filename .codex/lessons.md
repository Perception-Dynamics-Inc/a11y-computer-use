# Lessons learned (append-only; newest at the bottom)

- The libatspi child cache goes stale when the AT-SPI event thread is on (`A11Y_COMPUTER_USE_ATSPI_EVENTS`); code that relies on fresh children (e.g. Calc grid editors, #475/#411) must not assume the cache is current.
- #489's Audacity track/clock labels were applied app-wide and leaked into the crash-recovery dialog (#505). Scope app-specific labels to the window/role they belong to.
- #512's same-app dialog occlusion refusal broke tests/test_server.py on every platform. Run test_server.py for any change that affects click results, not just Linux suites.
- #498 (Qt toggle click, #493) may have regressed `test_linux_qt_line_edit_combo_and_values` on main. Qt click changes must run the Qt live tests' synthetic equivalents and check line edits/combos.
- GTK comboboxes: options were capped at the first 64 children (#513, fixed in #516). Never cap option lists silently; look up the requested value among all children and say when an error list is truncated.
- The first #503 attempt (dropping GTK 4 nodes with garbage sizes) broke the huge Calc and combo popup tests. Large-but-valid geometry is legitimate; only filter clearly uninitialized sizes.
- 2026-10-13 (#480): Linux maps native AT-SPI terminals to AXTextArea; inspect native terminal ancestry, including remembered editable handles, rather than treating every multiline editor as a shell. Preserve cached-field ownership checks before terminal detection so stale focus still returns an audited focus_changed error. Execution permission is independent of per-app FULL grants and defaults off for MCP Runtime hosts as well as agents.
